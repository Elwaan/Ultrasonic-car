# Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Car

This project is the final outcome of our embedded systems diploma at Amit, showcasing an autonomous car that detects and avoids obstacles in real time.
Features:

1. Microcontroller: An ATmega32 microcontroller processes sensor inputs and actuates the motors accordingly.
2. Obstacle Detection: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to scan the surroundings.
3. Wide-Angle Scanning: A servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor for broader coverage.
4. Autonomous Movement: Two DC motors drive the back wheels for forward motion.
